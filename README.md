# SORCERY
## Game Materials

Chessboard (8x8 checkered board), 16 white pieces, 16 black pieces, 32 cards (4 HP, 
3 self-destruct, 6 skip opponent’s turn, 9 blank, 5 fire columns, 2 moat, 2 curse, 1 resurrection)

## Set-Up
The pieces are set up on the board like a typical chess game would be. There is an ability card located under each square in the middle (i.e. squares where there are no pieces initially). Each player’s king starts with two (2) health points (HP). 

## How to Play
1）The player with white pieces has the first turn.

2）Move a piece of choice, following the rules of piece movement. 

3）If there is an ability card under the piece’s current position, it activates and applies to that piece. If the ability card is an HP card, the king’s HP increases by 1 point.

4）Discard the card. It will not be reused. 

5）Repeat steps 2-5, alternating players until one player has won.
